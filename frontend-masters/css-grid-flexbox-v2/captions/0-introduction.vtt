Hello everyone, my name is Jen Kramer, I am a instructor, I've been teaching HTML
and CSS for over 20 years. most recently at Harvard University but I've taught
in all kinds of environments, academic and commercial environments workshops and
online courses, all kinds of other things.

And I am so excited to present to you the second version of my course on CSS grids
and Flexbox layouts. Let's take a look at all of the cool things that you're gonna
learn inside of this course.

First, we're gonna start with Flexbox. And we're gonna take a look at all types of
different Flexbox properties. And how you can set up Grid based layout systems
using Flexbox across, of course, all of the various media queries.

We'll move on to a cool trick that we can use with figures and figure captions among
other types of HTML markup. This is going to allow us to layer our figure captions
on top of figures here.

For a really lovely looking web page and then we're gonna put together those two
pieces of learning that Grid system and this concept of wearing our captions with
the figures Into a webpage project here, the first part of it.

Where we will lay out a series of images here with lovely overlays describing all
of these various types of images. We'll take a quick peek at CSS shapes, and look
at the lovely way we can make our texts go on a slant like this.

And of course we'll work on our footer layout and that will work across our various
breakpoints. So of course, we're going to go to different layouts as we hit our
different breakpoints here in that particular web page.

Then we'll move on to adding a header and a footer for our webpage. We'll look at
Flexbox and how we can make very interesting looking navbars.

Here is an example where we have our logo in the middle of the navbar, and then
as we squash the screen down here, we wind up with the navbar underneath the logo
on the top and then finally we'll turn our navigation into a series of buttons
all using CSS.

Then we'll move on to adding responsive images to the website we'll talk about the
various approaches to as responsive images, including the picture elements. We'll
look at source set and sizes as ways of loading responsive images. And we'll include
this hero element on the page as well as a featured print.

And then using those responsive images depending on what break point we have to
be looking at We'll look at different versions of that picture on the webpage.

Finally, to wrap up the Flexbox portion of this course, we will move on to adding
the popular prints section of this homepage for a fully completed homepage by the
end of the Flexbox unit of the course.

Then we'll move on to CSS Grid. As always, we'll start with looking at the various
individual properties. And we'll do that by looking at a painting by Piet Mondrian
and will code it up with CSS Grid. Then we're going to look at the same kind of figure
in figure caption tricks that we did with Flexbox using.

Absolute and relative positioning now we're going to make that happen instead using
CSS Grid and Grid's fantastic ability to overlap cells and so we don't need to use
absolute relative positioning, we can just use Grid to overlap those cells.

That also means we can do other kinds of cool things with Grid like this by overlapping
to figures and using CSS animation to fade in and out different pictures on the webpage.

We'll move on to adding a different section of the homepage. In this case it will be
a mosaic based layout. We will have all different types of pictures of different heights,
and widths, and spanning over rows, and columns, inside of our lay out and of
course we'll wind up making that responsive as well.

We'll then take a look at some magazine styled layouts, so here we've got a series
of cats on our page, and they have different placements and different sizes and
different images and so forth.

We'll look at how easily we can make that kind of magic happen without any math,
and just simply assigning a few classes and changing a few properties, you can
achieve these types of layouts.

And finally, we'll do a very cool trick here with cards. So we'll create cards that
have one particular layout here on desktop, they'll move on to a very different
kind of layout.

Notice how we had the image in the middle of the text here. Now we've got the image
on the left the text on the right, with Grid and then finally back to a different
type of layout here on mobile devices and we'll walk through how we can do that
making use of Flexbox and Grid and more Grid inside of grids.

And then finally, we'll build our final website where you have lots of choices for
how that might look. This happens to be the way that I came up with it.

Another mosaic style layout of a bunch of beautiful donut pictures, and a cool
overlay of the text here on top of one of the images inside of the Grid cell.

When we get to smaller dimensions that tech shows up first, with the images stacked
nicely underneath.

81
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.605
As always with this course, it comes with
a website which will give you all of

82
00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:50.486
the background information, all of
the links to the various code pens, some

83
00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:55.840
additional pointers and guidance along the
way as we work through the information.

84
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.542
And it's broken up into a chunk of
material pertaining to Flexbox and

85
00:06:00.542 --> 00:06:03.310
a chunk of material pertaining to Grid.

86
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.780
So you can refer to this as you work
through the materials on the course.

87
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.093
And finally, all of the files
are available on GitHub, so

88
00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:13.122
you can download all of the files and

89
00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:17.680
follow along with everything that
I'm doing here in the course.

90
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.060
I am really excited to be recording
an update to the Flexbox and Grid course.

91
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.500
I've reworked almost all of the material
from the original version of this course.

92
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.578
And I'm including all kinds of new
techniques and new inspirations for

93
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:39.413
you that I hope will inspire you to make
more interesting layouts using Flexbox and

94
00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:39.931
Grid.

95
00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:41.091
So let's get started.
